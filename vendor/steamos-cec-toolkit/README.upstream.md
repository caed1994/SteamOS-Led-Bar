SteamOS CEC Toolkit adds living-room HDMI-CEC behavior to DIY SteamOS /
Steam Machine / HTPC builds. It installs scripts, systemd units, and
WirePlumber overrides so Game Mode can control the TV/AVR chain like a console.
An optional Decky plugin provides a Game Mode control panel.

It was built for a living-room SteamOS box where:

- A controller Home/Guide/Steam-button press should wake/power on the TV/AVR
  over HDMI-CEC and switch the active input back to the SteamOS box.
- SteamOS can optionally wake/power on the TV/AVR and select the SteamOS input
  automatically when Game Mode starts after cold boot.
- SteamOS should be able to send TV standby when the system sleeps or shuts
  down.
- SteamOS can optionally suspend when the TV broadcasts HDMI-CEC standby.
- SteamOS can optionally suspend after the TV/AVR switches away from the
  SteamOS HDMI-CEC source.
- Supported Bluetooth adapters and controller receivers can optionally be set up
  to wake SteamOS from suspend before the toolkit sends CEC wake/input
  selection.
- Gamescope can optionally be recovered after CEC wake/input switching if the
  display comes back in a bad state.
- SteamOS Game Mode can show relative volume controls (`+` / `-`) instead of a
  normal software volume slider, and those buttons can control the real
  receiver / soundbar volume over HDMI-CEC.
- The original Steam Controller has a HID fallback profile for wake/input
  switching if Linux does not expose a normal gamepad Home button event.

Features are configurable from the Decky plugin or from the
`steamos-cec-toolkitctl` command-line helper after the toolkit has been
installed.

The project uses Valve's existing SteamOS CEC daemon (`cecd`) and PipeWire
ExternalVolume plumbing.

## Install

Recommended install path:

Run this on the SteamOS machine as the normal desktop user, usually `deck`:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/Twsts/steamos-cec-toolkit/releases/latest/download/steamos-cec-toolkit-installer.sh)
```

The installer will:

- download the latest release assets
- ask which features you want to enable
- install the CEC volume shim and root helpers
- optionally install the Decky plugin
- discover CEC devices where possible
- restart Decky Loader if the plugin is installed

This is the recommended path for most users. It installs the core toolkit,
asks which features to enable, and can install the Decky plugin. A manual
`git clone` + `./install.sh` install is supported, but it is an advanced path:
it does not install the Decky plugin automatically, and optional features must
be enabled with flags.

If you install the Decky plugin, open Game Mode and use the `SteamOS CEC`
plugin:

1. Open `Configuration`.
2. Press `Discover CEC Devices`.
3. Use `Actions` to test wake/input selection.
4. If you want SteamOS volume buttons to control CEC audio, run
   `Discover Audio Output`, confirm `Volume Initiator`, `Audio Target`, and
   `HDMI Audio Card`, then test volume.
5. Toggle the features you want under `Features`.

If you enable `CEC Volume Buttons`, reboot once before judging whether SteamOS
Quick Settings has switched from the normal slider to `+` / `-`. The CEC volume
actions can work immediately while Steam/Game Mode still needs a fresh session
to attach the PipeWire ExternalVolume route.

If the plugin does not appear immediately, restart Steam or reboot.

If you do not use Decky, the toolkit can still be managed from the command line:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl status
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl wake
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl volume up
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl volume down
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl standby
```

Development builds can be installed from `main` with:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Twsts/steamos-cec-toolkit/main/scripts/easy-install.sh)
```

## Requirements

- SteamOS / Steam Deck-style Game Mode on a DIY HTPC.
- Decky Loader if you want the Game Mode plugin UI. The toolkit itself can be
  installed without Decky and managed from the command line.
- A working CEC adapter exposed as `/dev/cec0` or similar.
- A TV/AVR/soundbar HDMI-CEC chain.
- `git`, `curl`, `sudo`, and `systemctl` available on the SteamOS desktop
  session.
- `unzip` if you install the Decky plugin from release assets.

## Hardware This Targets

Known-good reference setup:

- SteamOS / Steam Deck-style Game Mode on a DIY HTPC.
- UGREEN DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter with HDMI-CEC support.
- TV + AVR/soundbar HDMI-CEC chain.
- Gamepad Home/Guide button support through Linux input events.
- Steam Controller for the Steam Controller HID fallback helper.

Controller wake from suspend has been tested on the reference setup with:

- Sony DualSense / PS5 controller over Bluetooth.
- Sony DualShock 4 / PS4 controller over Bluetooth.
- Original Steam Controller.
- 8BitDo controller over Bluetooth.

Other adapters and controllers may work, but you should verify the CEC topology
and whether the controller exposes a normal gamepad Home/Guide input event.

## What It Installs

User files:

```text
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-volume
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-external-volume
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-boot-wake
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-steam-button
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-tv-standby-suspend
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-input-away-suspend
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-gamescope-recovery
~/.config/systemd/user/cec-audio-control.service.d/override.conf
~/.config/systemd/user/steamos-cec-*.service
~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/99-steamos-cec-external-volume.conf
```

Controller wake support is passive. It does not remap, inject, block, or grab
controller input. The generic path watches gamepad-like Linux input devices for
known system button codes (`BTN_MODE`, `KEY_HOMEPAGE`, `KEY_HOME`) and ignores
keyboard/mouse devices. The Steam Controller fallback still uses the original
Steam Controller HID profile, with support for both the older and newer
Steam Controller / Steam Controller Puck firmware report formats observed in
SteamOS updates.

Root files:

```text
/etc/steamos-cec-toolkit.conf
/etc/atomic-update.conf.d/steamos-cec-toolkit.conf
/etc/sudoers.d/zz-steamos-cec-toolkit-volume
/var/lib/steamos-cec-toolkit/steamos-cec-volume-raw
/var/lib/steamos-cec-toolkit/steamos-cec-before-sleep
/var/lib/steamos-cec-toolkit/steamos-cec-permissions-apply
/var/lib/steamos-cec-toolkit/steamos-cec-usb-wake-apply
/etc/systemd/system/steamos-cec-before-sleep.service
/etc/systemd/system/steamos-cec-resume-wake.service
/etc/systemd/system/steamos-cec-permissions.service
/etc/systemd/system/steamos-cec-usb-wake.service
/etc/udev/rules.d/70-steamos-cec-toolkit.rules
```

USB/Bluetooth wake from suspend depends on the USB/Bluetooth adapter, firmware,
kernel, and controller. The toolkit can enable Linux USB wakeup for matching
Bluetooth/controller receivers, but it cannot make unsupported hardware wake the
PC from suspend. By default it matches USB Bluetooth radios by Bluetooth device
class, controller receiver names, and a small known-safe USB ID list for devices
that do not expose a readable product name.

CEC device access can also change after suspend, hotplug, or a SteamOS update.
The toolkit installs a small root helper, systemd unit, and udev rule to keep
the configured `/dev/cec*` device readable and writable by the SteamOS desktop
user so the user-level `cecd` service can reattach the adapter.

On SteamOS systems with atomic-update support, the installer also writes:

```text
/etc/atomic-update.conf.d/steamos-cec-toolkit.conf
```

This asks SteamOS to preserve the toolkit-managed `/etc` files across OS
updates, including the systemd units, udev rule, sudoers rule, root helpers,
and toolkit config. It reduces update breakage for files managed by this
project, but it cannot protect Decky Loader, SteamOS internals, WirePlumber
behavior changes, or files outside the configured keep-list.

## SteamOS Updates and Recovery

SteamOS updates can replace or reset parts of the system image. User files in
the SteamOS desktop user's home directory usually survive, but anything under
`/etc`, `/var/lib`, systemd unit state, WirePlumber behavior, Decky Loader, or
SteamOS CEC internals may change after an OS update.

Common symptoms after an update:

- Game Mode goes back to the normal volume slider.
- The `SteamOS CEC` Decky plugin shows `Missing` for a helper or sudoers rule,
  if you installed the plugin.
- Feature toggles are present but do not do anything, if you use the plugin.
- CEC discovery works, but volume or TV standby actions fail.
- Decky Loader itself needs to be reinstalled or restarted, if you use Decky.

If you use Decky, the plugin is the first place to check:

- `Root helper`, `Debug helper`, `Power standby helper`, and `Sudoers` should be
  `OK`.
- `CEC volume buttons` should be `On` if you want `+ / -` instead of the normal
  slider.
- `Relative volume` should be `OK` when ExternalVolume is active.
- If the `Install / Repair` section appears, it lists what is missing. CEC
  device permission problems can usually be repaired directly from the plugin;
  missing root helpers still require rerunning the installer.

The normal repair step is simply to rerun the latest installer:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/Twsts/steamos-cec-toolkit/releases/latest/download/steamos-cec-toolkit-installer.sh)
```

This refreshes the root helpers, sudoers rule, systemd units, WirePlumber
override, CEC device permission repair, and optionally the Decky plugin. It
keeps your runtime choices in:

```text
~/.config/steamos-cec-toolkit/config.conf
```

To verify SteamOS atomic-update persistence on systems that include
`holo-sync-var`, run:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/Twsts/steamos-cec-toolkit/releases/latest/download/steamos-cec-toolkit-installer.sh) --verify
```

The installer keeps the atomic update manifest installed either way. `--verify`
adds a `holo-sync-var --dry-run all` check and reports if SteamOS would still
discard project-managed files on the next update.

After rerunning the installer, Decky users can open the plugin, run
`Discover CEC Devices`, and toggle preferred features back on if needed. Without
Decky, use:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl status
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl discover-cec
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl discover-audio
```

## Why Relative Volume Needs a Shim

SteamOS has an official user service:

```text
/usr/lib/systemd/user/cec-audio-control.socket
/usr/lib/systemd/user/cec-audio-control.service
```

It exposes a Varlink interface:

```text
org.pipewire.ExternalVolume
```

WirePlumber can attach this ExternalVolume socket to the HDMI ALSA card. When
Steam sees usable relative-volume capabilities, Game Mode changes from a normal
volume slider to `+` / `-`.

Some AVRs ignore CEC volume commands from the SteamOS playback device logical
address, but accept the exact same command when it is sent as if it came from
the TV logical address. The toolkit replaces the `cec-audio-control` service
with a small Varlink shim that still speaks `org.pipewire.ExternalVolume`, but
uses `cec-ctl --raw-msg -f <initiator> -t <audio-system>` for volume.

Default behavior:

```text
initiator: 0  (TV)
target:    5  (Audio System)
```

## Quick Install

Most users should use the one-command installer above.

## Manual Install

Manual install is intended for development, testing, or users who do not want
the release installer. It installs the same core toolkit files, but it skips the
interactive feature prompts, release asset download, Decky plugin installation,
and post-install discovery summary.

Running `./install.sh` with no feature flags does not enable every feature. It
installs the base toolkit and ExternalVolume integration, while services such as
controller wake/input switching, boot wake, TV standby suspend, input inactive
suspend, Gamescope recovery, sleep/shutdown TV standby, and USB wake must be
enabled explicitly.

Clone the repo on the SteamOS machine as the normal SteamOS desktop user:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Twsts/steamos-cec-toolkit.git
cd steamos-cec-toolkit
```

Install the ExternalVolume integration and controller TV wake/input-switch
helper:

```bash
./install.sh --enable-steam-button
```

Install everything:

```bash
./install.sh \
  --enable-steam-button \
  --enable-boot-wake \
  --enable-tv-standby-suspend \
  --enable-input-inactive-suspend \
  --enable-gamescope-recovery \
  --enable-before-sleep \
  --enable-usb-wake
```

Then restart Steam/Game Mode or reboot.

## Release Assets

Each GitHub release should include:

```text
steamos-cec-toolkit-installer.sh
steamos-cec-toolkit-decky.zip
steamos-cec-toolkit.tar.gz
SHA256SUMS
```

Build them from a clean checkout:

```bash
scripts/build-release-assets.sh v0.1.0
```

Upload example:

```bash
gh release create v0.1.0 \
  release/steamos-cec-toolkit-installer.sh \
  release/steamos-cec-toolkit-decky.zip \
  release/steamos-cec-toolkit.tar.gz \
  release/SHA256SUMS \
  --title "v0.1.0"
```

## Decky Plugin

This repository includes an optional Decky plugin under:

```text
decky/
```

The plugin is a Game Mode control panel for an already bootstrapped toolkit. It
can:

- show ExternalVolume/toolkit status
- toggle SteamOS CEC volume buttons on/off so you can switch between relative
  `+ / -` control and the normal SteamOS volume bar
- toggle controller wake/input switching, boot wake/input switching, TV standby
  suspend, input inactive suspend, SteamOS sleep/shutdown TV standby,
  Bluetooth/controller wake from suspend, and Gamescope recovery
- discover CEC devices and choose the volume initiator/audio target from
  dropdowns
- test TV wake/input selection
- test volume up/down/mute
- restart the CEC audio/WirePlumber path

The plugin intentionally does not create sudoers rules or write root-owned
system files. Install the toolkit from Desktop/SSH first, then use the plugin
for day-to-day control if desired. Runtime choices made in the plugin are
written to:

```text
~/.config/steamos-cec-toolkit/config.conf
```

Build the plugin:

```bash
cd decky
npm install
npm run build
```

For local testing, install the built Decky plugin using Decky Loader developer
tools or copy the plugin directory according to your Decky development workflow.

## Configure Your Machine

The installer creates:

```text
/etc/steamos-cec-toolkit.conf
```

The Decky plugin and `steamos-cec-toolkitctl` can write user-level overrides for
common runtime choices. For system defaults, edit:

```bash
sudoedit /etc/steamos-cec-toolkit.conf
```

Important defaults:

```bash
CEC_DEVICE=/dev/cec0
STEAMOS_CEC_USER=<install-user>
CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR=
CEC_AUDIO_LOGICAL_ADDRESS=5
CEC_SIMPLINK_ACK=0
HDMI_ALSA_CARD_NAME=alsa_card.pci-0000_03_00.1
HDMI_ALSA_CARD_NICK="HDA ATI HDMI"
EXTERNAL_VOLUME_ROUTE=hdmi-output-0
```

On official SteamOS images the install user is normally `deck`. On other
self-installed SteamOS-style systems, the installer writes the user that ran the
installer.

Find CEC topology:

```bash
cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 --show-topology
```

Find the HDMI ALSA card:

```bash
wpctl status
pw-cli ls Device
```

After changing config, rerun the installer or regenerate the WirePlumber file:

```bash
./install.sh --enable-steam-button
```

## Command-Line Control

`steamos-cec-toolkitctl` is the CLI equivalent of the Decky control panel. It
prints JSON so it can be used from SSH, scripts, or bug reports.

Discovery and status:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl status
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl discover-cec
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl discover-audio
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl discover-input
```

Direct actions:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl wake
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl standby
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl volume up
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl volume down
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl volume mute
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl debug-cec 3
```

Toggle user services:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-service steam-button on
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-service boot-wake on
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-service tv-standby off
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-service input-away-suspend on
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-service gamescope-recovery on
```

Toggle system-backed features:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-system-service power-standby on
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-system-service usb-wake on
```

Toggle SteamOS relative volume buttons:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-external-volume on
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl restart-external-volume
```

Update user-level configuration:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-config '{"CEC_DEVICE":"/dev/cec0"}'
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-config '{"CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR":"","CEC_AUDIO_LOGICAL_ADDRESS":"5"}'
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-config '{"HDMI_ALSA_CARD_NAME":"alsa_card.pci-0000_03_00.1","EXTERNAL_VOLUME_ROUTE":"hdmi-output-0"}'
```

Repair CEC device permissions after a SteamOS update or hotplug issue:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl repair-cec-permissions
```

## Verify ExternalVolume

Check the Varlink capabilities:

```bash
varlinkctl call \
  unix:/run/user/1000/cec-audio-control/org.pipewire.ExternalVolume \
  org.pipewire.ExternalVolume.GetCapabilities \
  '{"device":""}'
```

Expected output includes:

```json
{
  "writeVolumeRelative": true,
  "writeVolumeRelativeStep": { "min": 1.0, "max": 1.0 },
  "writeMuteToggle": true,
  "routes": ["hdmi-output-0"]
}
```

Test volume:

```bash
varlinkctl call \
  unix:/run/user/1000/cec-audio-control/org.pipewire.ExternalVolume \
  org.pipewire.ExternalVolume.WriteVolumeRelative \
  '{"device":"","route":"hdmi-output-0","step":1.0}'
```

If the receiver volume moves, the shim is working.

## CEC Debug Capture

The optional Decky plugin has a Debug panel that can capture a short window of
live CEC messages. This uses a narrow root helper because `cec-ctl
--monitor-all` normally requires root on SteamOS.

From SSH/Desktop you can run the same capture manually:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl debug-cec 3
```

The capture window is intentionally limited to 1-5 seconds. It is meant for
checking routing, source activation, standby broadcasts, and volume commands
without leaving a long-running root monitor behind.

## Hardware and Topology Notes

The defaults match a common UGREEN DP-to-HDMI CEC adapter setup where SteamOS is
a playback device, the TV is logical address `0`, and the receiver/audio system
is logical address `5`. Other HDMI chains can differ.

Check topology:

```bash
cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 --show-topology
```

Then update `/etc/steamos-cec-toolkit.conf` if needed:

```bash
CEC_DEVICE=/dev/cec0
CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR=
CEC_AUDIO_LOGICAL_ADDRESS=5
CEC_SIMPLINK_ACK=0
HDMI_ALSA_CARD_NAME=alsa_card.pci-0000_03_00.1
HDMI_ALSA_CARD_NICK="HDA ATI HDMI"
EXTERNAL_VOLUME_ROUTE=hdmi-output-0
```

The toolkit is configurable, but not fully topology-agnostic yet. In
particular, some receivers accept volume only from the TV logical address while
others may accept it from the SteamOS playback address. HDMI/WirePlumber card
matching can also vary by GPU, adapter, and distro image.

Leave `CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR` empty for the normal validated path where the
kernel uses the SteamOS adapter's current logical address. Set it to `0` only
for receivers or soundbars that require TV-originated volume commands. If there
is no separate Audio System on the CEC bus and the TV renders audio itself, use
`CEC_AUDIO_LOGICAL_ADDRESS=0`; LG TVs may also need `CEC_SIMPLINK_ACK=1`.

## Input Switching

The `steamos-cec-steam-button` service watches controller Home/Guide input
events from gamepad-like Linux input devices. It also keeps the original Steam
Controller HID profile as a fallback. When triggered, it wakes/powers on the
TV/AVR chain and activates the SteamOS HDMI source by calling SteamOS `cecd`:

```bash
busctl --user call \
  com.steampowered.CecDaemon1 \
  /com/steampowered/CecDaemon1/Daemon \
  com.steampowered.CecDaemon1.Daemon1 \
  Wake
```

It triggers on:

- supported controller Home/Guide button events
- original Steam Controller connect/resume
- original Steam Controller short Steam-button press
- SteamOS resume, through a root systemd service that runs after suspend

On a working CEC topology this is the same behavior users expect from a console:
press the controller button, the display wakes, the AVR/TV selects the SteamOS
input, and Game Mode appears.

## Boot Wake and Input Switching

The optional `steamos-cec-boot-wake` service runs once when the SteamOS user
session starts. It waits briefly for `cecd`, checks whether the SteamOS
HDMI-CEC source is already active, and if not sends SteamOS' standard CEC wake
command with retries. This is intended for console-style cold boot behavior:
power on the SteamOS machine, then let it wake the TV/AVR and select the
SteamOS input automatically.

The Steam Controller HID fallback supports both older and newer Steam
Controller / Steam Controller Puck firmware report formats. The older report
uses this default parsing:

```bash
STEAM_BUTTON_HID_ID=0003:000028DE:00001304
STEAM_BUTTON_REPORT_ID=0x45
STEAM_BUTTON_BYTE=4
STEAM_BUTTON_MASK=0x01
```

The newer report path uses:

```bash
STEAM_BUTTON_ALT_REPORT_ID=0x44
STEAM_BUTTON_ALT_BYTE=1
STEAM_BUTTON_ALT_VALUES="0x03,0x04"
STEAM_BUTTON_ALT_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS=20
```

Other controllers use the generic gamepad Home/Guide input-event path when
Linux exposes a supported system button event.

On the reference setup, suspend wake plus CEC TV/input activation has been
tested with DualSense, DualShock 4, Steam Controller, and 8BitDo controllers.
This depends on the Bluetooth/USB adapter being allowed to wake the machine from
suspend, so unsupported adapters may still need platform-specific tuning.
On some desktop AMD systems, a controller can wake the PC electrically while the
OS resumes only partially. If the machine responds to ping but has no display
and no SSH after Bluetooth wake, check BIOS power-management settings such as
`Power Supply Idle Control` and `Global C-state Control`.

## Optional TV Standby Suspend

Enable with:

```bash
./install.sh --enable-tv-standby-suspend
```

This listens for TV broadcast standby:

```text
source:      0  (TV)
destination: 15 (broadcast)
opcode:      0x36 (Standby)
```

Then it runs:

```bash
systemctl suspend
```

## Optional Input Inactive Suspend

Enable with:

```bash
./install.sh --enable-input-inactive-suspend
```

This watches the SteamOS CEC device `Active` property from `cecd`. When the
TV/AVR switches away from this HDMI input, `Active` changes from `true` to
`false`. The service waits for a configurable delay, then suspends SteamOS if
the input did not become active again.

The delay prevents false suspends during short HDMI/CEC routing glitches:

```bash
INPUT_INACTIVE_SUSPEND_DELAY_SECONDS=60
```

From the Decky plugin, enable `Input Inactive Suspends SteamOS` under Features. When
enabled, use `Input Inactive Delay` under Configuration to choose the delay.

## Optional SteamOS Sleep/Shutdown TV Action

Enable with:

```bash
./install.sh --enable-before-sleep
```

This installs a system service that sends a configured HDMI-CEC action before
SteamOS sleeps or shuts down. It can be toggled from the Decky plugin or with:

```bash
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-toolkitctl set-system-service power-standby on
```

The default action is:

```bash
CEC_SLEEP_TV_ACTION=standby
```

This sends normal HDMI-CEC Standby and turns off most TVs/AVRs. Some Smart TVs,
including some Philips Android/Titan OS models, cold-boot after receiving CEC
Standby. For those TVs, use:

```bash
CEC_SLEEP_TV_ACTION=inactive-source
```

This sends HDMI-CEC Inactive Source instead of Standby. It tells the TV that the
SteamOS source is no longer active without broadcasting a full power-off request.

## Optional Gamescope Recovery

Enable with:

```bash
./install.sh --enable-gamescope-recovery
```

This watches the `Active` property from `cecd`. When this source becomes active,
it can restart `gamescope-session.target` after a short delay. This is useful on
some HTPC setups where switching back to the SteamOS input leaves Game Mode in a
bad display state.

When enabled, recovery is also cooldown-protected after system resume, after the
configured DRM connector reconnects while CEC reports this source as active, and
after the TV reports CEC power `on` while this source is already active. This
handles cases where SteamOS wakes from a Bluetooth/controller event, CEC already
thinks the SteamOS source is active, but the TV/AVR path still shows no video or
Game Mode stays in a bad display state. Controller button presses only send CEC
wake/input commands; they do not directly restart Gamescope.

Configure the connector status path in:

```bash
GAMESCOPE_CONNECTOR_STATUS=/sys/class/drm/card0-DP-1/status
GAMESCOPE_RECOVER_AFTER_RESUME=1
GAMESCOPE_RECOVERY_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=30
GAMESCOPE_CONNECTOR_POLL_SECONDS=1
GAMESCOPE_RECOVER_ON_TV_POWER_ON=1
GAMESCOPE_TV_POWER_POLL_SECONDS=3
```
